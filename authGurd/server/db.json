      "title": "THE BENEFITS OF LEVERAGING AN UNREAL ENGINE PARTNER",
      "desc": "Making video games has become increasingly fascinating and complex as we've progressed through decades of technological advancement. Especially nowadays, the video game industry has been able to garner more revenue than the film and music industry combined, according to SuperData Research. As more creatives get into the fray as indie developers, one of the first questions asked after coming up with an idea is, What engine should we use? While quite a few options are available, including creating a proprietary engine, there are immense benefits to leveraging an established engine like Unreal.The Unreal Engine by Epic Games, otherwise known as the engine behind genre-defining and radically impressive titles such as Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Fortnite, the Batman: Arkham series, and many more, is a versatile and in-depth game engine that's easily accessible and has been used for a plethora of titles. While its origins link back to the mid-90s, Epic Games has continued to push the envelope on what features are available to developers to create their dreams. However, to really utilize the full power of Unreal, especially as a small developer, collaborating with an Unreal Partner can be a cost-effective and long-term benefit. Experienced Unreal developers can not only offer their technical expertise to deliver impactful resources, guidance, and assistance in the development process but also assist in the maintenance of titles after they've been released and even use third-party assets in tandem with the Unreal library to truly make an amazing game!",

      "desc": "DevOps is the culmination of development and IT operations uniting with the ultimate goal of designing and expediting the delivery of software-based services and applications. The collaboration of software development and systems administration has created a powerful dynamic that utilizes diverse skills from departments that have not traditionally collaborated. This collaboration results in a new synergy that drives business goals and elevates the client-developer relationship by accelerating software development and customized app project completion, reducing time to market without sacrificing quality or data security.Re-Imagining Development WorkflowDevOps is designed to reduce or eliminate ‘hand offs’ of software development projects that often contribute to bottlenecks, focusing on developing streamlined communication between software development teams and operations. The collaborative environment aims to share project responsibility and enable continuous feedback, allowing any project code bugs to be addressed and rectified more expediently",

Artificial Intelligence’s application within the challenging world of law enforcement has enabled personnel to expedite document processing and gain a unique insight into data that can further assist with unsolved crimes.Artificial Intelligence can provide law enforcement with cutting-edge resources to mitigate crime and counter the continued trend of decreasing staff retention. Still, advocacy groups have cautioned decision-makers about its drawbacks, citing case law that states it may pose a threat to civil liberties. Government officials have responded, but heavy investments, according to a recent study by Stanford University, report an allocation of $3.3 billion for AI-based resources within the FBI, CIA, and U.S. Army, showing a great deal of confidence in AI’s demonstrative success across several industries.",

      "desc": "With different areas of modernity showing incredible promise, one of these is slowly improving and being implemented across an impressive range of industries. Extended Reality, or XR, encompasses a blend of technologies built to immerse users within their blended digital and physical worlds. These technologies include Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Mixed Reality. While Extended Reality is relatively new, there are plenty of uses for it that range from simple entertainment to complex tasks like professional training within healthcare and visualization and manipulation of 3D models for architects. As a result, XR can address a multitude of issues and be beneficial to not just the industries mentioned above but the real estate and gaming industries could also see improvements.A study conducted by the National Library of Medicine showed that using 3D systems like XRs leads to improved efficacy in learning skills and retaining information. This, alongside the fact that medical school overall has become far more demanding, the future generation of healthcare professionals can benefit significantly from a safer, hands-on approach. A concept like this is bolstered by this sector's overall acceptance of new technologies. In fact, within education as a whole, the same benefits can be applied holistically to schools of any kind. Even in the manufacturing and design sector, a lot of time and money can be saved through XR to streamline development. All of this to say, things are good, but they can be better!",

      "desc": "In today’s radically expansive and involved society, we’ve seen the pitfalls of traditional operations and the importance of streamlined or automated tasks. This is something felt across a multitude of industries. Manufacturing has felt the financial strain of overstocking due to poor inventory management, costing a staggering $471 billion in 2020 alone, as indicated in a report disclosed by Statista. The energy and utilities sector is on an aging infrastructure, causing higher downtime, maintenance costs, and even potential safety hazards. The aforementioned industries, and more, could reap the reward of Robotic Process Automation (RPA).UiPath is a leading provider of RPA software. Robotic Process Automation allows businesses to automate reason-based, repetitive processes with the use of software robots, otherwise known as “bots.” Bots can mimic how humans interact with a system and then fulfill said task, whether that be data extraction, data entry, calculations, or form filling, among other things. One of the most recognizable examples of RPA implementation can be attributed to Uber. Finding it difficult to match their growth rate, they turned to a team of talented software developers and UiPath and, through automation, were back on track and saved upwards of $22 million in the process!Plus, with other industries like telecommunications also suffering from some level of increased complexity and significant decreases in customer satisfaction and revenue, a partnership might just be the road to more sustainable operations.",
